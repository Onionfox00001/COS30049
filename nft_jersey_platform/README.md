NFT JERSEY PLATFORM NOTES
Welcome to our NFT Football Jerseys webpage project! This project aims to provide a platform for selling non-fungible token (NFT) football jerseys. Below are instructions on how to set up and run the code locally.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Node.js: Download and Install Node.js
npm: npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

Running the Code
To run the code locally, follow these steps:

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory if you haven't already.

Run the following command to start the development server: npm run dev

Once the server is running, you should see a message indicating the local server address (typically http://localhost:3000).

Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local server address.

Additional Notes
If you encounter any issues during installation or running the code, feel free to create an issue in this repository.

If your device doesn't have Next.js installed, you can install it using the following command: npm install next

Make sure to run npm run dev again after installing Next.js to start the web server.
